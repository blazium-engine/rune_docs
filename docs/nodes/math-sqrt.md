## Description

The Sqrt node calculates the square root of a numeric value. For negative inputs, the result will be NaN (not a number).

## Execution Inputs

None (data node, no execution flow)

## Variable Inputs

- **Value** (number): The number to calculate the square root of

## Execution Outputs

None (data node, no execution flow)

## Variable Outputs

- **Result** (number): The square root of the input value

## Special Notes

- If the input cannot be parsed as a number, the result defaults to "0.0"
- Negative inputs will produce NaN (not a number)
- This node doesn't have execution pins - it's a pure data node

## Example Usage

Calculate square roots for mathematical operations, distance calculations, or scaling operations. Connect a number output to the Value input, then use the Result output in other calculations or comparisons.
