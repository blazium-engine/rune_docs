# Multiply Node

The Multiply node performs multiplication of two numbers.

![Multiply Node](https://placehold.co/600x400/EEE/31343C)

## Description

The Multiply node calculates the product of two numeric values. It accepts any numeric input (integer or float) and returns the result as a number.

## Execution Inputs

None (data node, no execution flow)

## Variable Inputs

- **A** (number): The first number to multiply
- **B** (number): The second number to multiply

## Execution Outputs

None (data node, no execution flow)

## Variable Outputs

- **Result** (number): The product of A and B

## Special Notes

- If either input cannot be parsed as a number, the result defaults to "0.0"
- The node works with both integer and floating-point numbers
- This node doesn't have execution pins - it's a pure data node

## Example Usage

Multiply values together, such as calculating areas, volumes, or scaling values. Connect number outputs from Integer or Float nodes to the A and B inputs, then use the Result output in other calculations or comparisons.
