# Log (e) Node

The Log (e) node calculates the natural logarithm (base e) of a number.

![Log (e) Node](https://placehold.co/600x400/EEE/31343C)

## Description

The Log (e) node calculates the natural logarithm (logarithm with base e ≈ 2.718) of a numeric value. For non-positive inputs, the result will be NaN (not a number).

## Execution Inputs

None (data node, no execution flow)

## Variable Inputs

- **Value** (number): The number to calculate the natural logarithm of

## Execution Outputs

None (data node, no execution flow)

## Variable Outputs

- **Result** (number): The natural logarithm of the input value

## Special Notes

- If the input cannot be parsed as a number, the result defaults to "0.0"
- Non-positive inputs (zero or negative) will produce NaN (not a number)
- This node doesn't have execution pins - it's a pure data node

## Example Usage

Calculate natural logarithms for mathematical operations, exponential growth calculations, or scientific computations. Connect a number output to the Value input, then use the Result output in other calculations or comparisons.
